## _COIT20269: MOBILE WEB APPS (HT1, 2024)_

The main outcome of this assignment is to create a three-tier hybrid mobile app running on a Smart Device. This means the app should have three parts â€“ client, server and database

- **Database** - Create and maintain a MongoDB document database using the Atlas cloud service for online storage of mobile app data.
- **Client** - Develop, test and maintain a hybrid mobile application using an integrated suite of mobile software development tools. More specifically on the client-side, use jQuery, jQuery Mobile, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. 
- **Server** - Develop, test and maintain an Express web server and API using JavaScript and Node.js with various Node.js packages. Data is stored locally on the mobile device and in the cloud (MongoDB). The API facilitates access to a MongoDB Atlas cloud database using the Node Express middleware.
